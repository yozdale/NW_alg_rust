# NW_alg_rust
My Implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch global sequence alignment algorithm in Rust.

Hello World, this is the first of my code to be put on github.

To use this code pass 2 sequence strings to the function nwallign() Ex:
nwallign(seq1, seq2);

The function will print out the alligned sequences of code and return their similarity score.
